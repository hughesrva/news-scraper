# news-scraper

### This is a simple app that uses Cheerio to scrape the Associated Press home page and display its articles' titles, summaries and links in a single feed.

### The user can then add their own note that others can see.

###### The app uses MongoDB to store the data, Mongoose to access it and Handlebars to render it. The data is pulled using a combintation of Axios and Cheerio. UI styled with Bulma.
